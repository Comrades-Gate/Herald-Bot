Python 3.7.7 was used to write all scripts.

Activate the Comrade's Gate conda environment to run any of the scripts.

plot_weekday.py reads Statbot data in CSV format and plots user activity from the dataframe(s) into two plots: one that considers all data comprehensively and another that only considers data past a date range that can be changed in the script. I have not been able to figure out how to read this information from a URL, but will update in future patches.
